## Objectives
In this class, we will explore the potential of using machine learning techniques in credit risk modeling. We will discuss the machine learning algorithms for customer segmentation and techniques to handle imbalanced dataset.

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] Recap on `prophet` and `LSTM` examples
* [ ] K-means clustering
* [ ] Handling imbalanced dataset


## Course materials
* slides [[link](TBD)]

## Suggested reading
* Chapter 6 of **Machine Learning for Financial Risk Management with Python**
* How to build credit risk models using Machine Learning? [[link](https://www.leewayhertz.com/build-credit-risk-models-using-machine-learning/)]
