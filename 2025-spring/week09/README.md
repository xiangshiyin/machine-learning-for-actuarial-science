## Objectives
In this class, we will continue the discussion on dealing with imbalanced dataset including different sampling and evaluation strategies. We will also go through a case study to build a credit risk model.

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] Evaluating models with imbalanced data
* [ ] Resampling methods for imbalanced dataset
* [ ] Demo - German Credit Data
