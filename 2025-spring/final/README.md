  * Smaller teams will only be approved under special circumstances with instructor approval.
* Timeline
  * **2025-03-10**: Deadline for students to self-organize and submit team formation.
  * **2025-03-17**: Instructor assigns students who have not yet joined a team.
  * **2025-03-24**: 
    * All project teams finalized.
    * Suggested project topics published.
  * **2025-04-07**: Project topics finalized and approved.
  * **2025-04-28**: **Final project presentation.**

# What
* Solve a real-world problem in the domain of actuarial science and risk management using machine learning techniques
  * Any dataset that you think is interesting to analyze and model with.
  * Dataset from your domain of expertise are highly welcome
* Suggested operations:
  * Define the problem to solve and the question to answer
  * Data collection and preparation
  * Data exploration and profiling
  * Detect outliers and missing values
  * Detect the patterns and trends in the data with statistical and visualization tools
  * Build and evaluate machine learning models on the data to help solve the problem
  * Experiment with different models, compare their performance and trade-offs, and find the best model with proper evaluation metrics
  * Interpret the model with proper tools and techniques
  * Build a dashboard to present the key findings and insights to share with stakeholders 
    * **Account for 5%** of the final project grade.
    * Here are the tools you can use to build a dashboard:
      * `Tableau` 
      * `Streamlit`
  * Build an API layer to serve the model to downstream applications
    * **Account for 5%** of the final project grade.
    * I/O
      * Input: the explanatory variables for your ML model ($x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, ...)
      * Output: the predicted value from your ML model ($\hat{y}$)
    * Here are the tools you can use to build an API layer:
      * `FastAPI` [[link](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)]
      * `Flask` [[link](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/URL_ADDRESS)]
      * `Streamlit` [[link](https://streamlit.io/)]

# Deliverables/Submissions 
* Source code
  * Jupyter notebook file containing all the source code and results you used in your data analysis and modeling
  * Please make sure your code is cleaned, well-documented, and easy to follow
* A brief report on the project
  * Background information of the project/dataset/ideas (**Required**)
  * Illustration on the methodologies and findings from the data analysis (**Required**)
