# Requirement
* Total students in class: 40
* Team size: 3-4 students
  * Smaller teams will only be approved under special circumstances with instructor approval.
* Timeline
  * **2025-03-10**: Deadline for students to self-organize and submit team formation.
  * **2025-03-17**: Instructor assigns students who have not yet joined a team.
  * **2025-03-24**: 
    * All project teams finalized.
    * Suggested project topics published.
  * **2025-04-07**: Project topics finalized and approved.
  * **2025-04-28**: **Final project presentation.**

# LLM Policies
- Although the general expectation is to avoid using LLMs for the project, specific use cases may be permitted if discussed and approved by the instructor.
- For approved LLM use cases, these additional deliverables are expected
  - Share the detailed usage of LLM in your project, including where & why
  - Share the learning curve and experience of using LLM
  - Share the tradeoffs of using LLM

# What
* Solve a real-world problem in the domain of actuarial science and risk management using machine learning techniques
  * Any dataset that you think is interesting to analyze and model with.
  * Dataset from your domain of expertise are highly welcome
* Suggested operations:
  * Define the problem to solve and the question to answer
  * Data collection and preparation
  * Data exploration and profiling
  * Detect outliers and missing values
  * Detect the patterns and trends in the data with statistical and visualization tools
  * Build and evaluate machine learning models on the data to help solve the problem
  * Experiment with different models, compare their performance and trade-offs, and find the best model with proper evaluation metrics
  * Interpret the model with proper tools and techniques
  * Build a dashboard to present the key findings and insights to share with stakeholders 
    * **Account for 5%** of the final project grade.
    * Here are the tools you can use to build a dashboard:
      * `Tableau` 
      * `Streamlit`
  * Build an API layer to serve the model to downstream applications
    * **Account for 5%** of the final project grade.
    * I/O
      * Input: the explanatory variables for your ML model ($x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, ...)
      * Output: the predicted value from your ML model ($\hat{y}$)
    * Here are the tools you can use to build an API layer:
      * `FastAPI` [[link](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)]
      * `Flask` [[link](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/URL_ADDRESS)]
      * `Streamlit` [[link](https://streamlit.io/)]


# Final Project Presentation
* **Time**: **2025-04-28 @ 7:15PM - 9:45PM EST**
* **Location**: WebEx Meeting
* **Format**: 8-minute presentation and 2-minute Q&A
* **Presentation**:
  * Expected scope includes
    * Project background
    * Project objectives
    * Key data analysis findings
    * Key machine learning model training and evaluation results
    * Key insights and conclusions
    * Project limitations and future work
  * If you have built a dashboard and/or API interface, please include a short demo in your presentation
  * Teams will [follow the order of group numbers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PV8Z56F4IvtMjSk-7MjvWcBdz24l1MUnjuzucB3RN8) to present their work
  * It is recommened to have one team member to present the project. Other team members can join in the Q&A session to help answer questions.
    * If needed, the dashboard and/or API interface can be presented by a separate team member as long as you can control the presentation timing.
  

# Deliverables/Submissions 
* Deadline: **23:59PM @ 2025-05-01 EST**
* Source code
  * Jupyter notebook file containing all the source code and results you used in your data analysis and modeling
  * Please make sure your code is cleaned, well-documented, and easy to follow
    * The code should be well aligned with the content of your presentation and report. Please remove any unnecessary code or comments.
    * In case you went through multiple iterations of code exploration, **please only include the final version of the code**
    * Please apply proper comments to help guide the reader to understand your code
  * If you have extra scripts backing the API and/or dashboard interface, please also include them in the submission and apply proper comments as well.
* A brief report on the project
  * Background information of the project/dataset/ideas (**Required**)
  * Illustration on the methodologies and **key findings** from the data analysis (**Required**)
  * Each team member's contribution on the project (**Required**)
  * Please use the report as a format to present the key findings and insights. The recommended length of the report is 3-5 pages.
