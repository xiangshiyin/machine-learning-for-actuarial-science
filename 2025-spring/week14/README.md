## Objectives
This week, we will conclude our hands-on demo with `streamlit`, focusing on how to turn machine learning models into interactive web applications. After that, we will shift gears and explore the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] `streamlit`
* [ ] What is NLP?
* [ ] Different use cases of NLP
* [ ] Typical NLP workflow
