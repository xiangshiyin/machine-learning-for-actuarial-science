## Objectives

# Overview
In our last class, we explored the Titanic dataset, examined it from multiple perspectives, and applied various feature engineering techniques to enhance its explanatory variables. Today, we will continue working with the Titanic dataset, focusing on model training and evaluation techniques to gain deeper insights into predictive modeling.

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] Streamline the data preparation process
* [ ] AutoML exploration
* [ ] Model evaluation
  * [ ] Classification problems
  * [ ] Regression problems
* [ ] Model interpretations
