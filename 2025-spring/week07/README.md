## Objectives
Time series modeling is the cornerstone for financial risk managment since financial data usually has a time dimension. In this class, we will do a survey of both the classic time series models and the cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] Classical time series modeling approaches
* [ ] Other Machine learning approaches
  * [ ] `prophet`
  * [ ] Frame the time series as a supervised learning problem
  * [ ] RNN & LSTM - the high level idea
