## Objectives
In this class, we will delve into the critical processes of data exploration and feature engineering within the context of machine learning. Our focus will be on understanding how to effectively analyze and transform raw data to enhance model performance.

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] **Data Exploration** - We will examine the techniques for summarizing datasets, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies.
* [ ] **Feature Engineering** - We will explore methods to create meaningful features from raw data, such as encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and generating new features from existing ones (including interaction terms, etc.)
