## Objectives
Actuarial science has traditionally been data-driven, utilizing statistical methods to assess risk, price insurance products, and manage reserves. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has significantly broadened the tools available to actuaries, allowing them to address more complex challenges and harness new types of data. However, the inherent opacity of some ML algorithms can undermine consumer trust and raise concerns among regulators. In this lecture, we will explore the intersections and distinctions between ML and actuarial science.

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] Machine Learning vs. Actuarial Science - the methodologies, principles, and opportunities
* [ ] Can we explain ML models?
  * [ ] Example - Tree based models
    * [ ] Generalized Linear Model (**GLM**) $\eta = g(\mu) = z^T \beta = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^D \beta_i z_i$
    * [ ] Generalized Additive Model (**GAM**) $g(\mu) = \beta_0 + f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2) + ... + f_D(x_D)$
    * [ ] Tree-base models (Decision Tree, Regression Tree, etc.)
  * [ ] General approaches - What's possible?
