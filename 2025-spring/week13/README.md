## Objectives
Here is a todo list for the offline learning:
* Model Serving
  * `FastAPI`
    * Experiment with [the example on FastAPI](../week12/notebook/fastapi_demo.py), see if you apply some changes and make it work.
    * Review the official documentation on `FastAPI` [[link](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/)]
  * `Streamlit`
    * Experiment with [the examples on `Streamlit`](../week12/notebook/), try to introduce different visualizations and UI components.
    * Review the official documentation on `Streamlit` [[link](https://docs.streamlit.io/)]
* NLP intro
  * Review the examples in the `scikit-learn` documentation on text classification using the bag of words approach [[link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/text/plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-text-plot-document-classification-20newsgroups-py)]
  * Try to figure out how to use `TF-IDF` extract features from text data.
  * Online research to figure out other approaches to create features for ML modeling on text data.
