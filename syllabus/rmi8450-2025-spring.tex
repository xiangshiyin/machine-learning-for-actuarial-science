\subsection{Course Website}
All class information will be posted on the \href{https://icollege.gsu.edu/}{iCollege} site. This includes lecture notes, assignments, key announcements, and links to additional websites with course-related materials. Additionally, source code, data, and other resources used in the class can also be found on our \href{https://github.com/xiangshiyin/machine-learning-for-actuarial-science}{GitHub repository}.

\section{Overview}
In this course, we will explore the application of machine learning algorithms in actuarial science and risk management through common use cases such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time series modeling
    \item Marketing campaign predictions
    \item Insurance claim predictions
    \item Credit risk modeling
    \item Operational risk modeling and fraud detection
    \item Natural Language Processing (NLP) and information extraction
\end{itemize}
We will begin each topic with an overview of the theoretical foundations of relevant statistical and machine learning models. Discussions will cover the pros and cons of each model, best practices for model selection and evaluation, and case studies demonstrating their real-world applications. For some classical models, we will also implement key algorithms from scratch to deepen our understanding. This approach aims to provide students with a comprehensive grasp of both the theoretical and practical aspects of these models.

\subsection{Intended Audience}
This course is designed for students who have a basic understanding of statistics and machine learning and are interested in applying these techniques to actuarial science and risk management. Basic knowledge of Python programming is required, and students should be comfortable with data manipulation and visualization using Python programming. We will do a quick survey of Python programming to ensure that everyone is on the same page but will not cover the basics in detail.

\subsection{Learning Objectives}
Upon successfully completing this course, students will gain the following knowledge and skills:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand the theoretical foundations of machine learning algorithms that could be applied in actuarial science and risk management
    \item Develop the ability to select and evaluate machine learning models for different use cases
    \item Apply machine learning algorithms to some real-world problems 
\end{itemize}


\section{Course Schedule}
The course schedule is shown below. However, the topics are subject to change based on the pace of the class and the feedbacks of the students. Please refer to the iCollege site for the most up-to-date information.

\section{Software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All programming activities will be performed on the your own laptop. Your laptop should have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed. Using the Anaconda installation (\url{https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install}) is a good start to have most of the packages we need for the class in one shot. Detailed installation instructions will be posted on the class home page on \href{https://gastate.view.usg.edu/d2l/home/xxxxxxxtbd}{iCollege} and \href{https://github.com/xiangshiyin/machine-learning-for-actuarial-science}{our course GitHub repository}
    \item If you are interested to explore new tools, you could also try Google Colab (\url{colab.research.google.com}). It is an online Jupyter Notebook environment with Python and free computing resources backed by Google. You may need to install certain packages yourselves if they are not available in the notebook environment.
\end{itemize}  

\section{Homework/Quizzes/Final Project}
Homework are assigned once every 2 weeks. There will be 2 online quizzes and 1 final group project over the whole semester.

\subsection{Homework}
Homework assignments are the continuation of a hands-on activities in class. Detailed information about the activity and expectation for successful completion are provided with the instructions. See the web site for the most recent and detailed information on these assignments. \textbf{Homeworks are individual assignments!} You may discuss the assignment with your classmates, but your ﬁnal answers should reﬂect your individual eﬀort. Completed assignments must be uploaded\footnote{Instructions on homework submission will be posted on the class home page on iCollege} by the deadline.

\subsection{Quizzes}
Quizzes will be given out after the regular class and comprise only a few questions. However, some questions may need some thinking and calculations.

\subsection{Final Project}
