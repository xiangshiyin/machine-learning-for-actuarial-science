\subsection{Contact the instructor}
During the term, it is highly recommended that you contact the instructor either during scheduled office hours or via email. The instructor is available to help you gain access to resources, focus your projects, and answer any questions you may have. Additionally, your classmates can also be a valuable source of assistance.

\subsection{Course Website}
All class information will be posted on the \href{https://icollege.gsu.edu/}{iCollege} site. This includes lecture notes, assignments, key announcements, and links to additional websites with course-related materials. Additionally, source code, data, and other resources used in the class can also be found on our \href{https://github.com/xiangshiyin/machine-learning-for-actuarial-science}{GitHub repository}.

\section{Overview}
In this course, we will explore the application of machine learning algorithms in actuarial science and risk management through common use cases such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time series modeling
    \item Marketing campaign predictions
    \item Insurance claim predictions
    \item Credit risk modeling
    \item Operational risk modeling and fraud detection
    \item Natural Language Processing (NLP) and information extraction
\end{itemize}
We will begin each topic with an overview of the theoretical foundations of relevant statistical and machine learning models. Discussions will cover the pros and cons of each model, best practices for model selection and evaluation, and case studies demonstrating their real-world applications. For some classical models, we will also implement key algorithms from scratch to deepen our understanding. This approach aims to provide students with a comprehensive grasp of both the theoretical and practical aspects of these models.
